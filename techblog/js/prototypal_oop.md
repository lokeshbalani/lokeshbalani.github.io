**OO vs Procedural**

In OO design, the attributes and behaviors are contained within a single object, whereas in procedural, or structured design, the attributes and behaviors are normally separated.

In OO terminology, data is referred to as attributes, and behaviors are referred to as meth- ods. Restricting access to certain attributes and/or methods is called data hiding.
