The hard truth is that we spent most of our time maintaining code. It is rare for us to write code from scratch. Most of the time we are building on code that is already there. Writing code in a maintainable way allows us, and others who will work on our code after us, to easily pick up where the code leaves off.

Here we will discuss Conventions, which will help our team write JavaScript code in the most effective way possible.

Why Code Conventions?
---------------------

Code Conventions are important because:

- Eighty percent of lifetime cost of a piece of software goes into maintenance
- Hardly any software is maintained for its whole lifetime by the same author
- They improve readability of the software, allowing engineers to understand new code more quickly and thoroughly
- If we ship our source code as a product, we need to make sure that it is well packaged and clean

Style Guidelines vs Code Conventions
------------------------------------

The terms “*style guidelines*” and “*code conventions*” are often used interchangeably. 

**Style guidelines** are a type of code convention aimed at the layout of code within a file. 

**Code conventions** can also include programming practices, file and directory layout, and commenting.

Why Style Guidelines?
--------------------

Style Guildelines allow the team to work at a much higher level, because all code looks the same, which is important because it allows:

- Any developer to work on any file regardless of who wrote it.
- Errors become more obvious. If all code looks the same, and we come across some code that doesn’t, we've likely found a problem.

Style guidelines are a personal thing and must be developed within a team to be effective.
