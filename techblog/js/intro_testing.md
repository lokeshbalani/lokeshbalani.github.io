What is Software Testing?
-------------------------
Software Testing can be stated as the process of validating and verifying that a software program or application or product:
- Meets the business and technical requirements that guided it’s design and development
- Works as expected

Why is it Useful?
-----------------
Testing is useful for the following reasons:
- Tests can evaluate a program’s correctness after a change. Automated testing helps discover errors before they happen in the “real world.”
- Tests can also function as good examples for other developers. If a developer is trying to figure out how to use some undocumented part of code, a well-written test can help him see how that piece works.
